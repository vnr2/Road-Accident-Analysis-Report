**Project Overview**

In this self-project, I created an Analysis dashboard/report on Road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022 using Power BI to uncover key insights and patterns that can help stakeholders understand the root causes of accidents, identify high-risk areas, and support data-driven decision-making for improving road safety. This Road Accident Analysis project leverages Power BI to comprehensively explore accident-related data. The dataset includes accident severity, location, time, weather conditions, road types, and vehicle involvement. Through interactive dashboards and visual storytelling, this project aims to find:

* Total Casualties and Total Accident values for the Current Year and YoY growth
* Total Casualties by Accident Severity for the Current Year and YoY growth
* Total Casualties concerning Vehicle type for the Current Year
* Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for the current year and the previous year
* Casualties by Road Type for the Current Year
* Current Year Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night
* Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location

Tools & Technologies Used
* Power BI Desktop - For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards
* Excel/CSV - as a data source and for preliminary data exploration
* Power Query - for Data Transformation and cleaning
* DAX - for custom calculations and metrics
